    "# cadCAD Tutorials: The Robot and the Marbles, part 2\n",
    "In [Part 1](../robot-marbles-part-1/robot-marbles-part-1.ipynb) we introduced the 'language' in which a system must be described in order for it to be interpretable by cadCAD and some of the basic concepts of the library:\n",
    "* State Variables\n",
    "* Timestep\n",
    "* State Update Functions\n",
    "* Partial State Update Blocks\n",
    "* Simulation Configuration Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will introduce the concept of __Policies__. But first let's copy the base configuration from Part 1. As a reminder, here's the description of the simple system we are using for illustration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The robot and the marbles__  \n",
    "* Picture a box (`box_A`) with ten marbles in it; an empty box (`box_B`) next to the first one; and a robot arm capable of taking a marble from any one of the boxes and dropping it into the other one. \n",
    "* The robot is programmed to take one marble at a time from the box containing the largest number of marbles and drop it in the other box. It repeats that process until the boxes contain an equal number of marbles.  "

    "# Policies\n",
    "In part 1, we ignored the `_input` argument of state update functions. That argument is a signal passed to the state update function by another set of functions: Policy Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Functions are most commonly used as representations of the behavior of agents that interact with the components of the system we're simulating in cadCAD. But more generally, they describe the logic of some component or mechanism of the system. It is possible to encode the functionality of a policy function in the state update functions themselves (as we did in part 1, where we had the robot's algorithm reside in the `update_A` and `update_B` functions), but as systems grow more complex this approach makes the code harder to read and maintain, and in some cases more inefficient because of unnecessary repetition of computational steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of a policy function is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def policy_function(params, step, sL, s):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return {'value1': value1, 'value2': value2, ...}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Just like State Update Functions, policies can read the current state of the system from argument `s`, a Python `dict` where the `dict_keys` are the __names of the variables__ and the `dict_values` are their __current values__. The Policy Function must return a dictionary, which will be passed as an argument (`_input`) to the state update functions.\n",
