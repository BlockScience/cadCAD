    "# cadCAD Tutorials: The Robot and the Marbles, part 7\n",
    "In parts [1](../robot-marbles-part-1/robot-marbles-part-1.ipynb) and [2](../robot-marbles-part-2/robot-marbles-part-2.ipynb) we introduced the 'language' in which a system must be described in order for it to be interpretable by cadCAD and some of the basic concepts of the library:\n",
    "* State Variables\n",
    "* Timestep\n",
    "* State Update Functions\n",
    "* Partial State Update Blocks\n",
    "* Simulation Configuration Parameters\n",
    "* Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "In [part 3](../robot-marbles-part-3/robot-marbles-part-3.ipynb) we covered how to describe the presence of asynchronous subsystems within the system being modeled in cadCAD. And [part 4](../robot-marbles-part-4/robot-marbles-part-4.ipynb) introduced Monte Carlo simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [part 6](../robot-marbles-part-4/robot-marbles-part-6.ipynb) we conducted A/B tests using different system initial conditions to see the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover cadCAD's support for parameters and parameter sweeping, a useful feature to produce multiple configurations with different parameters. As in Part 6, let's start by copying the base configuration with which we ended Part 4. Here's the description of that system:\n",
    "\n",
    "__The robot and the marbles__  \n",
    "* Picture a box (`box_A`) with ten marbles in it; an empty box (`box_B`) next to the first one; and __two__ robot arms capable of taking a marble from any one of the boxes and dropping it into the other one. \n",
    "* The robots are programmed to take one marble at a time from the box containing the largest number of marbles and drop it in the other box. They repeat that process until the boxes contain an equal number of marbles.\n",
    "* The robots act __asynchronously__ and __non-deterministically__; at every timestep each robot acts with a probability P: 50% for robot 1 and 33.33% for robot 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have added a new parameter in the `robot_arm` function called `capacity`. This is the amount of marbles a robot can move from one box to the other each time."
